The AI engineer's work began by confirming user requirements for the EMERGENT: AI-Powered Optimization Platform, a React/FastAPI web application integrating with the existing ShinkaEvolve framework. The plan focused on incremental development, prioritizing Phase 1 (Problem Input) and Phase 2 (Analysis) with WebSocket streaming for real-time updates and no user authentication for the MVP.

The initial implementation involved setting up the FastAPI backend and React frontend structure, including core files, dependencies, and environment variables. Key challenges emerged during this phase: Python import errors, an SQLite threading issue within ShinkaEvolve, difficulties with the external preview URL due to Kubernetes proxy and agent sleep mode, and persistent WebSocket connection errors. The AI engineer systematically addressed these by adjusting import paths, implementing  in ShinkaEvolve's database logic, configuring dynamic URL detection in the frontend, adding WebSocket heartbeats, and debugging database path issues related to ShinkaEvolve's internal directory management. A missing numpy dependency for evaluation was also identified and fixed.

The trajectory concludes with the user reporting connessione negata da localhost, indicating that even after numerous fixes and attempts to guide the user towards using localhost, the local connection is still failing, possibly due to the previous attempt to remove the redirect component.

<product_requirements>
The ShinkaEvolve project aims to be an evolutionary algorithm framework for LLM-based code generation/optimization. Previous work established core functionalities: Thompson Sampling (Context-Aware), Deterministic LLM Caching, a low-cost deduplication system, a production-grade  for reproducible agent logging, and Darwin GÃ¶del Machine (DGM) integration for external evaluation/mutation.

The current major requirement is to build the EMERGENT: AI-Powered Optimization Platform, a React web application with a FastAPI backend. This platform must offer an intuitive, 5-phase guided workflow: Problem Input, Analysis & Parameterization, State-of-the-Art Research, Evolution Simulation (real-time via WebSocket), and Results & Comparison. A critical feature is problem-aware dynamic adaptation, where the UI, metrics, visualizations, terminology, research, code generation (, ), and LLM commentary adapt to specific problem types (e.g., TSP, Scheduling). The platform needs to be highly usable, performant, seamlessly integrated, and scalable. User explicitly confirmed using Emergent Universal Key (with GPT-5 fallback), focusing on Phase 1-2 initially, no authentication for MVP, prioritizing TSP and Scheduling, and WebSocket for real-time updates.

**Code Architecture Summary:**
The application follows a standard MERN-like stack (React/FastAPI/MongoDB). The existing  framework serves as a core backend dependency.

-   ****: A new directory created by cloning the  repository. This houses the  core logic.
    -   : The central orchestrator for evolution, integrated by the FastAPI bridge.
    -   : Handles SQLite database operations. Modified to include  to resolve threading issues with FastAPI's asynchronous nature.
-   ****: A new FastAPI application acting as a bridge between the React frontend and .
    -   : The main FastAPI entry point, configured with CORS, connects to MongoDB, and includes routes from .
    -   , , : Define API endpoints for problem input, analysis, and the evolution process, including WebSocket handling.
    -   , , , : Contain business logic for LLM interaction, problem analysis,  integration (e.g., dynamic  and  generation), and WebSocket management.
    -    & : Manage backend environment variables (including  and ) and Python dependencies.
-   ****: A new React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
    -   : Manages routing for different phases (Home, Problem Input, Analysis, Evolution Dashboard).
    -   , , , : Implement the UI for the 5-phase workflow, with  and  being the most developed, and  containing a basic structure for real-time visualization.
    -   : Contains sub-components for the  (e.g., , , ).
    -   : Handles API calls to the FastAPI backend, including dynamic URL detection.
    -   : Custom React hook for managing WebSocket connections and processing real-time updates from the backend.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving persistent WebSocket connection errors and ensuring the EMERGENT platform's core phases (Problem Input, Analysis, and a foundational Evolution Dashboard) were functional. The frontend, backend, and WebSocket communication are now mostly set up for Phases 1, 2, and the skeleton of Phase 4.

Key achievements in the latest interaction include:
1.  **Backend Integration:** Successfully cloned DarWin Symbiont, created a FastAPI bridge () for , and established WebSocket routes () for real-time updates.
2.  **Frontend Workflow:** Implemented ,  (Phase 1),  (Phase 2), and a basic  (Phase 4) pages in React. Recharts was installed for charting capabilities.
3.  **WebSocket Fixes:** Addressed the  by:
    *   Adjusting  to dynamically detect the backend URL, mirroring  logic.
    *   Implementing a heartbeat mechanism in  to prevent premature WebSocket closures.
    *   Adding basic  message handling in .
4.  **Database/Path Issues:** Resolved various  and  issues by:
    *   Correcting Python import paths in backend services and routes.
    *   Modifying  to use  for SQLite.
    *   Debugging ShinkaEvolve's internal absolute path generation, and modifying  to manage session directories more robustly (though this was an iterative fix, still a source of subtle issues).
    *   Installing missing  dependency, which was causing evaluation failures.
5.  **LLM Key Configuration:** Ensured the backend correctly utilizes the Emergent Universal Key for LLM operations by configuring .
6.  **Preview URL Troubleshooting:** The AI engineer has extensively debugged external preview issues, attributing many to Kubernetes proxy problems,  sleep mode, and incorrect  configurations. A  component was attempted and then removed.

The very last message from the user, connessione negata da localhost, indicates a new or recurring issue where even direct localhost access is failing, immediately after the  component was disabled.

<optional_next_step>
Troubleshoot the connessione negata da localhost error, focusing on verifying backend binding and frontend  configuration for localhost access.
