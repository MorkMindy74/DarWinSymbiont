The trajectory details the incremental development of the ShinkaEvolve framework. Initially, the AI engineer implemented and refined a  and a  system. A  was then introduced, adapting to evolutionary phases. The first major task involved building a comprehensive benchmark harness for this context-aware bandit, including hard-mode benchmarks, ablation studies, hyperparameter sensitivity, and cache testing, culminating in a  system. Subsequently, a robust  system was developed for reproducible agent archiving, featuring manifest enrichment, dirty repo handling, lineage tracking, and a CI regression harness. Most recently, the DarWin Gödel Machine (DGM) was integrated as a git submodule, enabling DGM benchmarks with results archived and reproducible. The AI engineer has successfully completed these complex integrations and is now tasked with building a full React/FastAPI EMERGENT AI-Powered Optimization Platform to provide a problem-aware UI for ShinkaEvolve.

<product_requirements>
The overarching project, ShinkaEvolve, is an evolutionary algorithm framework for code generation/optimization using LLMs. Initial requirements included:
1.  **Thompson Sampling Bandit:** Dynamic LLM selection, corrected for adaptive reward normalization.
2.  **Deterministic LLM Caching:** Persistent SQLite-based caching for LLM queries to enhance efficiency.
3.  **Context-Aware Thompson Sampling:** An advanced bandit adapting to evolutionary phases, maintaining separate beliefs per context.

These features aimed to make the evolutionary process smarter, faster, and more cost-effective, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark suite and a low-cost deduplication system. A production-grade  for reproducible agent logging and  integration for external evaluation/mutation were also implemented.

The current major requirement is to build the **EMERGENT: AI-Powered Optimization Platform**, a React web application with a FastAPI bridge. This platform must provide an intuitive, 5-phase guided workflow: Problem Input, Analysis & Parameterization, State-of-the-Art Research, Evolution Simulation (real-time via WebSocket), and Results & Comparison. A critical aspect is **problem-aware dynamic adaptation**, where the UI, metrics, visualizations, terminology, research, code generation (for  and ), and LLM commentary all adapt to the specific problem type (e.g., TSP, Circle Packing, Scheduling, Agent Design, Neural Architecture Search). The system needs to be highly usable, performant, seamlessly integrated, and scalable.

The engineer thoroughly tested the DGM integration, including benchmark execution and  for a DGM agent, confirming its functionality. All criteria for safe, reversible, and production-ready DGM integration were met. The previous AI engineer then received new, extensive requirements to build the **EMERGENT: AI-Powered Optimization Platform,** a full React web application with a FastAPI backend to provide a problem-aware UI for ShinkaEvolve. The very last message confirms the understanding of this new task and states the intent to begin by creating the project structure and core components for this new platform.
