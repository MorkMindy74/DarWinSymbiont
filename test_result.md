    message: "✅ ALL TESTS PASSED: Comprehensive testing completed successfully. All 5 core functionality areas verified: (1) Core imports work correctly, (2) Thompson Sampling basic functionality operational, (3) Context-Aware functionality with proper context switching, (4) Benchmark harness integration with MockLLMScorer for all problem types, (5) Complete minimal benchmark runs with CSV logging. Additionally, all 17 existing unit tests in test_context_aware_bandit.py continue to pass. The ShinkaEvolve implementation is solid and the benchmark system works correctly."
